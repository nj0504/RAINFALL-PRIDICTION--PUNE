# RAINFALL PRIDICTION (PUNE)
 Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for various applications such as crop yield estimation, flood forecasting, and storm warnings. However, rainfall is highly variable over space and time, making accurate prediction challenging. Existing methods like numerical weather models have limited skill, especially for short-term forecasts. Here we present a data-driven approach using random forest to predict rainfall occurrence one day in advance.  Rainfall prediction is formulated as a binary classification problem based on meteorological predictors. The random forest model is trained on historical weather data from Pune, India. Features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover are used to train an ensemble of decision trees. The individual tree predictions are aggregated through voting to give the overall rainfall occurrence forecast.  The proposed approach provides an interpretable and high-accuracy solution to short-term rainfall prediction. It has significant advantages over numerical prediction models in terms of computational efficiency and ease of implementation. The data-driven methodology is promising for integration with numerical models to improve forecast skill. This could pave the way for developing hybrid rainfall prediction systems
